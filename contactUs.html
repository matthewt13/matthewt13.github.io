			<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
			
			<h5>Is SilkQuartz a Nano coating?</h5>
			<p>Yes, SilkQuartz is at a nano scale. This molecular coating is approximately 500 times thinner than a human hair which is approximately 100nm thick. 1nm is 1 billionth of a 1m.</p>
			
			<h5>Is SilkQuartz the same as SiO2 or LiquiGlas?</h5>
			<p>Yes once its applied and cured.</p>
			
			<h5>What is LiquiGlas (SiO2)</h5>
			<p>SiO2 LiquiGlas is a coating of pure, safe, quartz glass, also known as silicon dioxide (SiO2). Quartz is in abundance on earth. It is also found in many foods, water and beer. When applied to a surface in its nano form, the layer is very thin and clear, and it is for this reason it has been named LiquiGlas. It doesn’t become “glass” until it’s allowed to dry.  Once dried the coatings are highly durable, flexible, super smooth, breathable and ‘Super Phobic’ coating.</p>
			
			<h5>Can the coating be seen?</h5>
			<p>No, it’s undetectable and colourless so it won’t change the look and feel of the surface. You need to use a microscope to see the coating.</p>
			
			<h5>Does SilkQuartz contain any harmful chemicals?</h5>
			<p>No. SiO2 technology is described as being particle free and is based on the polymerisation of SiO2 molecules. It has long been known to be chemically inert. The curing process doesn’t entail any toxic fumes being released, however being in a well ventilated area and using gloves during the application is good practice. The coating will bond to the surface (substrate) through the Van der Waals process which means the particles will arrange themselves to form a permanent bond with the surface.<br><br>Here are some interesting facts:
			<ul>
				<li>Humans require SiO2 in their diet.</li>
				<li>SiO2 forms a significant part of a whale’s diet. The walls of phytoplankton are in essence SiO2</li>
				<li>SiO2 is used as a flow agent in ketchup and toothpaste.</li>
				<li>SiO2 is used in different industrial applications.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h5>Is SilkQuartz environmentally friendly?</h5>
			<p>Yes. It contains SiO² (silicon dioxide / quartz / liquiglas) which is thankfully in abundance and non-hazardous. The molecules can be held in a liquid medium which in this instance is alcohol. When the “liquid” is applied to a surface (substrate) a polymerisation process occurs. After some time polymerisation is complete (the alcohol has evaporated) and what’s left is a chemically inert, ultra-durable and ultra-thin layer of pure SiO2. SiO2 is recognised as a significant technology in the fight to protect our world.</p>
			<p>Once surfaces are coated with SilkQuartz it drastically reduces the need to use chemicals in the cleaning process. It’s also worth mentioning that our supplier strictly adheres to prevailing regulations to ensure the safety of the company and the quality of its products. All production facilities work together with their employees in such a way as to preserve natural resources. Pollution of the environment with chemicals and carbon is avoided by reducing the amount of waste and defective goods.</p>
					
			<h5>Does SilkQuartz have any antibacterial and bio static properties?</h5>
			<p>SilkQuartz does have bio static properties. All of the surfaces which are treated with SiO2 coatings become bio static and this is because the surface is highly cationic (+ charge). This action destabilises the wall of bacterium and so the bacterium can’t subdivide / reproduce. The NHS in the UK recognise and use SiO2 coatings in their efforts to combat infections in their facilities.</p>
			
			<h5>​Is SilkQuartz a permanent structure?</h5>
			<p>Yes, it is.  However, environments have different levels of wear and tear. Examples of this could be exposure to the elements, the abrasive actions such as windscreen wipers, salt spray and mineralisation that impact significantly on the life of the coating.</p>
			
			<h5>So what are the benefits?</h5>
			<p>By applying SilkQuartz to the surface you are creating a protective layer on the surface. This layer will repel dirt, grime and inhibit corrosion caused by exposure to the elements. There is a significant reduction in surface damaging corrosion such as mineralisation, salt burn and etching. Surfaces look better for longer.</p>
			
			<h5>Is the product guaranteed?</h5>
			<p>We value our customers' support and feedback. We know that SiO2 technology works really well if the application is done correctly. We have designed our labels in the most simplest way to ensure that the process is clearly understood. Based on tests and customer response we are very confident in our products however due to the nature of coatings its highly dependent on the competency of the user (applicator) and therefore our commitment to customer satisfaction is as follows; We offer a refund on any unopened and undamaged product, pro rata to the purchase price excluding postage and handling if a customer is unhappy with our products. Our liability statement can be accessed <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/e5fdf9_52c95a1191264692823b066d166e867d.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
			
			<h5>Will a surface with SilkQuartz be self-cleaning?</h5>
			<p>No. SilkQuartz will create an “easier to clean” surface. In vertical hard down pours self-cleaning may occur but all surfaces require routine cleaning maintenance. Without a doubt you will find that surfaces coated with SilkQuartz are much easier to clean and you will use less earth damaging detergents and in some instances no cleaning agents are required at all, merely a wipe with a cloth will remove dirt from the surface.</p>
		
			<h5>Is SilkQuartz Superphobic?</h5>
			<p>Yes. It is very hydrophobic and simultaneously oleophobic (hydrophobic + oleophobic = superphobic).</p>
			
			<h5>What is a contact angle?</h5>
			<p>Contact angles become relevant when surfaces are given hydrophobic properties. A contact angle is a measurement of how hydrophobic a surface is (how does a droplet bead on the surface), the higher the contact angle, the more hydrophobic a surface is, SilkQuartz has a high contact angle.</p>
			
			<h5>How much coating should be rubbed onto the surface?</h5>
			<p>SilkQuartz should be worked into the surface and the liquid should be dispersed over the entire area. If the same area is wiped twice the liquid may be visible however once curing has taken place however this can be buffed over and no over application will be visible. The application should be done in a methodical manner and done with urgency. Our kit contains two applications and each application should treat 2m2 of surface.</p>
			
			<h5>The coating appears to have lost its hydrophobicity, why?</h5>
			<p>The coating may have been worn away due to wear and tear or it requires a thorough clean to expose the coating. If a wash using your preferred cleaning agent doesn’t restore the hydrophobic characteristics, then try using our cleaning wipe or an alcohol cleaner to rejuvenate the coating. If this doesn’t work the SiO2 may very well be worn off the surface.</p>
			
			<h5>Will SilkQuartz bond to all surfaces.</h5>
			<p>No. SilkQuartz is optimised for Glass and Ceramic. Also, ensure that the surface is clear and in good condition otherwise the coating won't bond. In the instance of badly contaminated glass try determine to what level it’s been stained and it may need more effort restoring the surface in preparation for the coating. Please refer to our cleaning and <a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/e5fdf9_7a61b46b6ba544649ae0128e1a4bf908.pdf" target="_blank">application matrix</a> for more info on this. Also, follow the application instructions correctly to experience excellent performance. We do have formulations that are optimised for textiles, timber, concrete and stone surfaces.</p>
			
			<h5>Is it possible to reapply SilkQuartz on the same surface?</h5>
			<p>Reapplication on the same surface isn’t a problem. The same process should be followed. Ensure the surface is clean and free of any contaminants. Step 1. Apply the cleaning wipe. Step 2. Apply SilkQuartz and allow to cure. Buff with a microfiber cloth after 2 hours or leave over night before buffing. Our kit has more detail on the application  process.</p>
			
			<h5>Is SilkQuartz heat tolerant?</h5>
			<p>Yes, SilkQuartz is stable between temperatures in the range -25°C to +300°C.</p>
